The purpose of the software is to remove the noise and correct for shaft friction from the micro-drill measurements collected by resistograph
in .rpd format.

To run it, change the current path to the folder which contains a set of "MicroDrill (.rgp) file processing / Version 1" codes and .rpd file.
Execute by ".\main.py .\FILENAME.rgp" (in windows).

It is compiled with the collection of python 3 codes. It takes a single .rgp file produced from a single micro-drill measurement, and

 - extracts measured data from .rgp, saves it in .csv, 
 - processes raw data, which is a measurement of resistance per (set via instrument) distance, 
 - adds a moving average curve to the drill amps, 
 - removes 0-values (or anything below a set threshold) that are produced before and after micro-drill instrument enters and exits a pile, based on threshold values, 
 - connects the two thresholds with a slope, and 
 - plots corrected for slope drill amplitude profile.

At the end, there is a .csv file, and multiple plots.
